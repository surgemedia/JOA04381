#Latest Updates

##Website navigation restructure
Rename some of the menu items to be more intuitive (see attached PDF with homepage and sitemap)

Homepage restructure
Make it more inline with your business requirements (see attached PDF with homepage and sitemap)

Implement the ’theme my login’ plugin. 
At the moment we are redirecting people to your general login page (http://www.joanbuttsbridge.com/wp-login.php) if people exidently login with the wrong details. This is really confusing.

##Lessons and memberships
I had a think about the lessons section and I think you should somehow offer people:
only ‘one’ free lesson if they are not logged in which would come with the free hand of the day aswell
if someone has a free membership we should only give them access to the first module
If someone is logged in as a royal member they get access to the lot.
A profile page for members
I think we need to do some work on the profile page and offer an easy way to upgrade to ‘royal’ membership.

##Pricing page
You need a easy to understand pricing page that explains what comes with the different packages ( the homepage mockup would be repeat of this)

##Timetable pages
The holiday timetable and the lesson timetable needs to be cleaned up and linked so you have just one area to update.
